• Smooth Transitions: The images transition smoothly from one to the next, providing a visually appealing experience.

## How to Use

• Navigate: Use the Previous (<) and Next (>) buttons to move through the images.

• Responsive Layout: Resize your browser window or view on a mobile device to see how the slider adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Files Included
